I direct the **Molecular Medicine Research Center**, currently being upgraded to a **Center of Excellence in Biobanking & Biomedical Research**, upon funding by the European Commission. Our activities include human molecular and medical genetics research and diagnostics, serving as a referral center for kidney conditions, not only for Cyprus but also for Greece. Our research uses cell biology and animal model tools aimed at investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms of disease development. Currently we are conducting a preclinical study on a mouse model for Alport Syndrome, while next month we are starting a clinical trial in a cohort of humans with another inherited kidney disease, in collaboration with the Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard. Our center includes also the first Biobank approved in Cyprus for genetic disorders.

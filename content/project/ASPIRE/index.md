'Assessment of Post-stroke Aphasia for Rehabilitation Research (ASPIRE)' involves interdisciplinary research aiming to improve the quality of life of stroke patients with Aphasia and address the enormous economic burden of post-stroke rehabilitation by attempting to translate scientific knowledge about the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) into applications for clinical practice. The project aims to obtain evidence through a pilot randomised control trial on the effectiveness of treatment protocols using TMS on language recovery after first-time stroke. 

Our <span style="color:green;">focus</span> is to incorporate molecular measures to assist personalized services regarding assessment, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of people with acute and sub-acute post-stroke aphasia in Cyprus. The general objective is to investigate the contribution of the individual patient genotype and biomarkers (microRNAs) in the aphasia profile and treatment components as well as the recovery and rehabilitation of people with post-stroke aphasia. Simultaneously, this will allow us to understand the basic neuroscience principles underlying principles of rehabilitation, mainly brain plasticity at the individual level. Recovery after stroke occurs on the basis of specific molecular events. Genetic polymorphisms (SNPs) and specific miRNAs have been associated with impaired neural repair or plasticity which might reduce recovery from stroke and might also account for some of the inter-subject variability in stroke recovery.

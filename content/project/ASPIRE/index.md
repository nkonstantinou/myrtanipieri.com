Assessment of Post-stroke Aphasia for Rehabilitation Research (ASPIRE) involves interdisciplinary research aiming to improve the quality of life of stroke patients with Aphasia and address the enormous economic burden of post-stroke rehabilitation by attempting to translate scientific knowledge about the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) into applications for clinical practice. The project aims to obtain evidence through a pilot randomised control trial on the effectiveness of treatment protocols using TMS on language recovery after first-time stroke. The goal of the project is to explore the feasibility of integrating brain stimulation as an adjunctive therapy into typical standard rehabilitation care for communication deficits. 
This project is funded by the Cyprus Research Promotion Foundation under Excellence Hubs 2016 (EXCELLENCE/1216).

`Alexithymia` increases risk for many forms of psychopathology and is characterized by `emotional deficits`, including when processing `emotional faces`. This study examines `face processing` under various `perceptual load` conditions in low and high alexithymic people. We record participants' reaction time (RT) and accuracy in cognitive tasks, psychophysiological measures of heart rate, skin conductance and baseline heart rate variability, and an index of emotion regulation and adaptability, in order to interpret differences in performance between the various groups of participants.

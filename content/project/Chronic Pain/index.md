Several imaging studies have identified localized anatomical and functional brain changes in `chronic headache sufferers`. The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has allowed for the exploration of alterations in brain activation in resting state connectivity and how such alterations relate to the head-pain experience and any new learned coping responses to pain. Evidence suggests that subcortical areas, together with frontal and temporal brain areas play a role in the experience of head pain, supporting the view that headache is a mainly subcortical disorder with substantial brainstem involvement. What is still unknown, however, is to explore the neural impact of a behavioral intervention for headache management in modulating targeted brain regions implicated in processing the head pain experience. In this study we investigate differences in `grey matter density` and `resting-state functional connectivity` between a group of head pain patients and age-matched healthy controls, and the interaction with measures assessing `psychological flexibility` with head pain responses, a targeted learned coping response stemming from `Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT)`, a new behavioral intervention for head pain management.

`Colours` are frequently associated to `emotions` in how we think and communicate. Whereas popular opinions are clear-cut, results from scientific studies are mixed (e.g. is red negative?). In this project we study implicit and explicit semantic `colour-emotion associations`. 

Our lab participants in a large-scale, international survey `(http://www2.unil.ch/onlinepsylab/colour/main.php)` in which we aim to assess `how color concepts (color terms)` associate to a large `variety of emotions`. Having respondents from many languages and cultures, we assess their commonalities and differences that are potentially based on biological or culturally (in)variant experiences. Further, mappings consist in multiple interrelated colour-emotional associations rather than exclusive one-to-one relationships. These data build on a comprehensive inventory of semantic colour-emotion associations that will allow us and others to develop and test further research questions. Results may also foster neighbouring research areas, in particular on how colour-emotion associations shape color preferences.

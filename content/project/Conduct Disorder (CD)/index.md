This project focuses on individuals with Conduct Disorder (CD). A main problem in the current literature is that many studies fail to take heterogeneity into account, despite evidence that the level of effectiveness of available treatments is highly variable across individuals. This variability has led to great interest in identifying meaningful antisocial subtypes to guide the design of effective treatments. To offer a comprehensive understanding of antisocial subtypes and suggest new interventions based on heterogeneity, the project will attempt to (1) identify theory driven symptom-based CD subtypes and test their validity based on existing multi-informant data, (2) test whether identified CD subtypes show distinct attention deficits and Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) activity in response to emotional stimuli, and (3) investigate the effectiveness of two treatments: Attention Modification Therapy (AMT) alone or combined with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS).

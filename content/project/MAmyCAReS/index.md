The main objectives of the **<span style="color:orange;">MAmyCAReS proposal </span>** [Milk Antibody Characterization after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in lactating mothers] are to determine the presence and isotypes as well as the neutralization capacity of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in breast milk of mothers who have received a vaccine against the ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Four vaccines have been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to target COVID-19 for emergency use in Europe. However, none of them are authorized or currently under investigation for use in infants or very young children. Even though young children are usually only mildly affected by COVID-19, there have been rare reports of the appearance of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in this population, linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection. One way to protect the younger population such as infants or young children until pediatric vaccines are licensed is through passive immunity via breastfeeding. Recent evidence points to the fact that human milk contains immunoglobulins (Ig) against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, after natural infection. Importantly, studies from our group and others have revealed that human milk contains Ig against the SARS-CoV-2 after administration of a vaccine against COVID-19 and these antibodies have neutralizing ability. Still, no one has ever examined if these Igs are still functional after infant digestion. In this study we will: 

1) compare the levels and isotypes of Ig in human milk at various time points after vaccination with either an mRNA-based vaccine or an adenoviral-based vaccine. 

2) compare vaccine-elicited Ig to those induce following natural infection and, 

3) examine the survival and neutralization capacity of vaccine-elicited and naturally induced Igs before and after digestion in a simulated human infant GI digestion system. Results from this study will help understand the physiology behind vaccine elicited immune response in lactating mothers and the extent to which these Igs can protect the breastfeeding infant or child.

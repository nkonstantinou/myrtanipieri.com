`MicroFOOD` is a proof-of-principle study funded by the Universitas Foundation and the University of Nicosia Seed grant with the aim of testing whether selected ingested beef miRNAs have the potential to withstand human digestion and regulate human genes initiating or adding to the progression of colorectal cancer. 
To examine the fate of ingestible miRNAs and their relation to disease, we are using in vitro digestion protocols, human cell lines and vivo testing via feeding studies in mice 
Additionally, since functional miRNAs such as bta-miR-154c are found to reach the human large intestine and since CRC patients have been found to demonstrate changes in their gut microbiota, we plan to test whether ingestible bovine miRNAs could directly regulate microbial gene expression and growth, altering in this way the human microbiome.

SUSTAIN, an Erasmus+ network 
SUSTAIN is an Erasmus+ project developing Citizen Science methodologies. The project will spark engagement and create new tools for teachers and students who study sustainable landscapes and bird migration. https://www.sustainablelandscapes.eu/
The SUSTAIN network has been awarded a EUR 449,900 grant by Erasmus+, the EU programme for education, training, youth and sport. The network will be coordinated by Science LinX, the science centre of the University of Groningen (UG) Faculty of Science and Engineering with the University of Nicosia being a partner. SUSTAIN aims to engage pupils and their families in research projects – what is known as citizen science on aspects of sustainability. The 12 partners will develop e-learning modules on ‘sustainable landscapes’ and research in Spain, Cyprus and the Netherlands, linking learning inside and outside the classroom.
For SUSTAIN, the million-dollar question is how society can use landscapes for industry, housing, agriculture and recreation without hampering biodiversity. This is a major issue for future generations, and young people must therefore be included in the discussion.
The project members – researchers, school teachers, science education providers and experts in science communication – will form a community of learners (CoL) and will develop e-learning modules on a topic relevant to the region. These will be made available to other schools in the third and final year of the project. At the end of the project, each of the three countries will host a science festival to reach a wide audience.

Social anxiety involves the persistent fear of one or more social situations in which the person may be evaluated, criticized and rejected. `Attention` deployment processes have been implicated in the aetiology and maintenance of social anxiety, though the specific role of attention in this condition is not yet entirely clear and continues to be a topic of vigorous investigation. This project examines whether social stimuli and especially `emotional faces` produce `attention bias` effects among socially anxious individuals in comparison to non-social stimuli, and whether `threatening faces` produce greater attention bias effects compared to neutral faces, depending on the `processing load` of cognitive tasks executed in parallel.

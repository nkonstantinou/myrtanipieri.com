Traumatic brain injury results in significant cognitive impairments, brain atrophy and altered brain functional connectivity. This project aims to investigate relationships between measures of cognitive function in TBI patients (vs. matched healthy controls) and the relationship with associated gray matter volume (using voxel-based morphometry - VBM), white matter anatomical connectivity (using diffusion tensor imaging - DTI) and functional connectivity (using fMRI).
This project received funding from the Cyprus Promotion Foundation through a grant co-funded by the Cyprus Government and the European Regional Development Fund (NEW INFRASTUCTURE/STRATEGIC/0309/37).

abstract: "Purpose: The -786 T/C polymorphism of the NOS3 gene (rs2070744) has been previously 41 linked to athletic performance with the T allele found to be present in higher frequency in 42 power-oriented athletes. Still, what remains elusive is the putative effect of this polymorphism 43 on specific measures of physical fitness and technical condition. In this study we examined 44 whether the NOS3-786 T/C genotype is correlated with specific physical or technical skills in 45 a cohort of adolescent basketball players. 46 
Methods: 85 young basketball players (59 boys and 26 girls) were evaluated in various 47 physical fitness parameters (agility, flexibility, speed, jumping ability, and aerobic capacity) as 48 well as technical skills (dribbling, shooting). All players were also genotyped for the NOS3 -49 786 T/C polymorphism. 50 
Results: The frequency of the TT genotype was positively correlated with better performance 51 in flying sprints times (10-20 secs; p=0.05, 5-10 secs; p=0.02, and 5-20 secs; p=0.01) as well 52 as with Counter Movement Jump (CMJ) (p=0.03) in boys. The heterozygous CT genotype was 53 correlated with better performance in the agility test for girls. In both sexes, no differences 54 were found between the other physical fitness parameters evaluated (p>0.05). 55 
Conclusions: The NOS3 -786 TT genotype appears to be correlated with better performance 56 in speeds and jumps in boys. These data agree with current literature associating the -786 TT 57 NOS3 genotype with power elite athletes. The molecular mechanism by which the TT genotype 58 may confer an advantage in power exercises is still under investigation."

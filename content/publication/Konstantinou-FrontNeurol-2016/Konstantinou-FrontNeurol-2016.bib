abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Characterize the scale and pattern of long-term atrophy in gray matter ({GM}), white matter ({WM}), and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) in chronic moderate-severe traumatic brain injury ({TBI}) and its relationship to neurocognitive outcomes. {PARTICIPANTS}: The {TBI} group consisted of 17 males with primary diagnosis of moderate-severe closed head injury. Participants had not received any systematic, post-acute rehabilitation and were recruited on average 8.36â€‰years post-injury. The control group consisted of 15 males matched on age and education. {MAIN} {MEASURES}: Neurocognitive battery included widely used tests of verbal memory, visual memory, executive functioning, and attention/organization. {GM}, {WM}, and {CSF} volumes were calculated from segmented T1-weighted anatomical {MR} images. Voxel-based morphometry was employed to identify brain regions with differences in {GM} and {WM} between {TBI} and control groups. {RESULTS}: Chronic {TBI} results in significant neurocognitive impairments, and significant loss of {GM} and {WM} volume, and significant increase in {CSF} volume. Brain atrophy is not widespread, but it is rather distributed in a fronto-thalamic network. The extent of volume loss is predictive of performance on the neurocognitive tests. {CONCLUSION}: Significant brain atrophy and associated neurocognitive impairments during the chronic stages of {TBI} support the notion that {TBI} results in a chronic condition with lifelong implications.}

abstract = {Working memory is responsible for keeping information in mind when it is no longer in view, linking perception with higher cognitive functions. Despite such crucial role, short-term maintenance of visual information is severely limited. Research suggests that capacity limits in visual short-term memory ({VSTM}) are correlated with sustained activity in distinct brain areas. Here, we investigated whether variability in the structure of the brain is reflected in individual differences of behavioral capacity estimates for spatial and object {VSTM}. Behavioral capacity estimates were calculated separately for spatial and object information using a novel adaptive staircase procedure and were found to be unrelated, supporting domain-specific {VSTM} capacity limits. Voxel-based morphometry ({VBM}) analyses revealed dissociable neuroanatomical correlates of spatial versus object {VSTM}. Interindividual variability in spatial {VSTM} was reflected in the gray matter density of the inferior parietal lobule. In contrast, object {VSTM} was reflected in the gray matter density of the left insula. These dissociable findings highlight the importance of considering domain-specific estimates of {VSTM} capacity and point to the crucial brain regions that limit {VSTM} capacity for different types of visual information.

abstract = {Load Theory of attention suggests that high perceptual load in a task leads to reduced sensory visual cortex response to task-unrelated stimuli resulting in "load-induced blindness" [e.g., Lavie, N. Attention, distraction and cognitive control under load. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 19, 143-148, 2010; Lavie, N. Distracted and confused?: Selective attention under load. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 9, 75-82, 2005]. Consideration of the findings that visual {STM} ({VSTM}) involves sensory recruitment [e.g., Pasternak, T., \& Greenlee, M. Working memory in primate sensory systems. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 6, 97-107, 2005] within Load Theory led us to a new hypothesis regarding the effects of {VSTM} load on visual processing. If {VSTM} load draws on sensory visual capacity, then similar to perceptual load, high {VSTM} load should also reduce visual cortex response to incoming stimuli leading to a failure to detect them. We tested this hypothesis with {fMRI} and behavioral measures of visual detection sensitivity. Participants detected the presence of a contrast increment during the maintenance delay in a {VSTM} task requiring maintenance of color and position. Increased {VSTM} load (manipulated by increased set size) led to reduced retinotopic visual cortex (V1-V3) responses to contrast as well as reduced detection sensitivity, as we predicted. Additional visual detection experiments established a clear tradeoff between the amount of information maintained in {VSTM} and detection sensitivity, while ruling out alternative accounts for the effects of {VSTM} load in terms of differential spatial allocation strategies or task difficulty. These findings extend Load Theory to demonstrate a new form of competitive interactions between early visual cortex processing and visual representations held in memory under load and provide a novel line of support for the sensory recruitment hypothesis of {VSTM}.}

abstract: "Alport syndrome (AS) is a severe inherited glomerulopathy caused by mutations in the genes encoding the α-chains of type-IV collagen, the most abundant component of the extracellular glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Currently most AS mouse models are knockout models for one of the collagen-IV genes. In contrast, about half of AS patients have missense mutations, with single aminoacid substitutions of glycine being the most common. The only mouse model for AS with a homozygous knockin missense mutation, Col4a3-p.Gly1332Glu, was partly described before by our group. Here, a detailed in-depth description of the same mouse is presented, along with another compound heterozygous mouse that carries the glycine substitution in trans with a knockout allele. Both mice recapitulate essential features of AS, including shorten lifespan by 30–35%, increased proteinuria, increased serum urea and creatinine, pathognomonic alternate GBM thinning and thickening, and podocyte foot process effacement. Notably, glomeruli and tubuli respond differently to mutant collagen-IV protomers, with reduced expression in tubules but apparently normal in glomeruli. However, equally important is the fact that in the glomeruli the mutant α3-chain as well as the normal α4/α5 chains seem to undergo a cleavage at, or near the point of the mutation, possibly by the metalloproteinase MMP-9, producing a 35 kDa C-terminal fragment. These mouse models represent a good tool for better understanding the spectrum of molecular mechanisms governing collagen-IV nephropathies and could be used for pre-clinical studies aimed at better treatments for AS.
